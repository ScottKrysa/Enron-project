# Tensorflow-Enron-project

The goal of this project is to create a fraud detection model based on the Enron email dataset.

## Part 1: Parse the Dataset and load it into a Pandas DataFrame.

  [+] email_analyzer Complete (Aug 1)
  [+] datetime objects added for later time series analysis

## Part 2: Analyze the elements and choose which to include in the ML model

  [-] bag_of_words completed but limited application.
  
  [-] intending to create a network analysis tool using the 'to' and 'from' emails
  
  [-] intending to create a sentiment analysis tool that can monitor trends over time, maybe correlate similar trends to ID co-conspirators

## Part 3: Build one or more models to analyze the elements from Part 2

## Part 4: Train and Test

## Part 5: Refine the model and identify ways that it can be employed in corporate environments (post-incident investigations, or as real -time trend-detection)
