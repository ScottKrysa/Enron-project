# Tensorflow-Enron-project

The goal of this project is to create a fraud detection model based on the Enron email dataset.

Part 1: Parse the Dataset and load it into a Pandas DataFrame.
Part 2: Analyze the elements and choose which to include in the ML model
Part 3: Build one or more models to analyze the elements from Part 2
Part 4: Train and Test
Part 5: Refine the model and identify ways that it can be employed in corporate environments (post-incident investigations, or as real time trend-detection)
