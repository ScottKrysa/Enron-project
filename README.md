Dipping my tow into the Tensorflow waters, focusing on fraud detection

## Initial Thoughts

**June 11, 2018**
*Downloaded dataset* 

'maildir' --> names of employees --> email folders ('inbox', 'deleted_items', etc..) --> indexed raw files (1, 2, etc..) 

Do I need a script to parse the directory and label the inputs? 
Or should I just feed all of the raw data into a single folder and use the labels within the raw text?
